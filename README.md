# SonyBraviaSmartControl
This was one of my first smart home projects to connect my Sony Bravia with OpenHab.

Bravia Smart Control is just a small project to control the Sony Bravia over openhab2 without creating a binding for it.
It's just experimental but it works fine.

The project contains the most important xml commands to turn on/off, change the volume, toggle mute and change the channel.
